I have been studying how I may compare this prison where I live unto the world
and for because the world is populous and here is not a creature but myself, I cannot do it
yet I'll hammer it out -- my brain I'll prove the female to my soul, my soul the father --
and these two beget a generation of still-breeding thoughts, and these same thoughts
people this little world with humors like the people of this world, for no thought is contented.
The better sorts, as thoughts of things divine, are intermix'd with scruples, and do set the word itself against the word.
